# Create a specialized .bib file just for one manuscript,
# by retrieving all citations in .bib format from the master
# database.
# 
# Assumes that .aux file contains lines of the form:
#   \citation{WeinsteinSteitz99,BachellerieCavaille98,Meguro01}
# and that these keys uniquely identify a bibtex entry in the
# master databases that can be retrieved by the 'lookup' script.
#
# Also assumes that the master bibliography is in ~/labbib/master.bib
# It needs this to extract the @string macros for journal abbreviations.
