# bibmerge - merge new BibTeX entries into a BibTeX database
#
# Usage: bibmerge <newfile.bib> <database.bib>
#
# newfile.bib is merged into database.bib; the merged entries
# are resorted by alphabetic order of keys; the merged entries
# are saved back into database.bib.
#
# Guaranteed not to clobber anything in <database.bib>; it can
# only grow.
#
# DIAGNOSTICS:
#   Warnings are printed about collisions; assign these new keys
#   in newfile.bib and remerge.
#
